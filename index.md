Skateboard lessons and coach for skateboard competitions. If you're just starting out, want to get better at skating, or need help training for a competition, we will help you achieve whatever your goals are.

Age group: young youth to teens.

Sign up and join our group skate class from Monday – Friday, 6pm – 7pm or book a 1 on 1 lesson Saturday – Sunday! (Safety gear equipment is mandatory!) Providing your own gear is recommended for your child’s comfort and safety. Have no gear? No fear! We have loaners on hand!
